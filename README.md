# pythonDiscordBot
Working Discord Bot developed on Python using discord.py 1.3.0

# How it works

**Required libraries**

You can install following using 'pip install' or 'conda' etc.
Also, few of them can be already installed on interpreter.

- discord
- asyncio
- json
- requests
- itertools
- traceback
- youtube_dl
- async_timeout
- selenium
- giphy_client

**Follow these steps**

1. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications and create an application.
2. Get your bot token and insert it into **first** line of the `token.txt` file.
3. Invite your bot to your discord server using developer's discord site on `OAuth2` section.
4. Launch the bot using `bot.py` file.

**About Docker**

Docker is done, I recommend to customize it before for your device, libraries and rest should remain the same.
